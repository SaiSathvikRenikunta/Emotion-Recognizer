            <p class="par"><br>Multimodal Emotion Recognition is
                a relatively new discipline that aims to include text inputs, <br>as well as sound
                and video.This field has been rising with the development of social networks<br>
                that gave researchers access to a vast amount of data.Recent studies have been
                exploring<br> potential metrics to measure the coherence between emotions from the
                different channels.</p>
